=== What ZimArchivist is? ===
Based on the fact that web changes evryday, the link you save in your zim notes could be obsolete (dead, the page moved...)
This is a bit annoying. The solution is to keep on your hard drive a copy of the web page.
To open it easely, ZimArchiver add a link to this copy next to the URL in your notes.
Just click on it, it will be opened in your broswer.


=== How to run ZimArchivist? ===
There is two ways to use ZimArchivist.

==== The Hacker's way ====
You can run the software from the command line. This means the job could be done by a cron task.


==== The zim way ====
In tool menu, add the zimarchivist command. 
You can choose to apply on one file or on the whole zim notebook.


=== OK, and the command is? ===

==== Make a cache of a specific file URLs ====
zimarchivist --cache -d ~/Notes -f ~/Notes/Home.txt

=== FAQ ===

==== Where I can found my archives? ====
There are located in .Archive in your notebook path.

==== Why the paths are ~/Notes and not /home/user/Notes? ====
This is because I'm syncing my notes on several computers with different usernames.
Thus, my paths work on every systems.

==== Is it dangerous for my notes? ====
I don't think so. I'm using it every day and I didn't see any drawback.
The thing you should know is that Zim does not reload the notebook when a file is modified.
This means you can have a conflict if you continue to edit your notes after a cache process.

Moreover, I keep track of my notes in a git repository. So, I can revert if something goes wrong.
You can do the same.
