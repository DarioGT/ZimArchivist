TODO list
---------

* Update doc (command line interface)


* review zimnotes.process_zim_file, zim_root might be unused now

* Revisit entirely the logging system
* Have a look to the Lib WeasyPrint. It generates pdf from html.
* The content ID (from mime) could be used as an ID for files instead of generated numbers


* Timout : Done in a quick and dirty fashion
